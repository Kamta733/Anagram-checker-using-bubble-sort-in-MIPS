# Anagram-checker-using-bubble-sort-in-MIPS
Two strings are said to be anagrams of each other if one string can be converted to form another string 
by rearranging the letters of one string and the number of characters in both the strings must be the same. 

We have developed an algorithm to check whether two strings are anagram or not. To do this we have used MIPS assembly language code and implemented the algorithm in MARS IDE

[MIPS assembly language : MIPS simply refers to the assembly language of MIPS processor. The term MIPS is an acronym for Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stage. It is a reduced-instruction set arcchitecture developed by an organization called MIPS.]
